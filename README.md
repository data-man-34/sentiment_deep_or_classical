# sentiment_deep_or_classical
Deep learning vs classical methods for Turkish sentiment analysis

In the sentiment analysis, text representation is the most important research topic as another natural language processing tasks.  In this study, word, semantic and character based representations of texts are compared for Turkish sentiment analysis. Classical and deep learning based approaches are used in data modeling. Character-based representations are more successful with both classical and deep learning based approaches. Moreover, a large-scale tagged data set has been presented for Turkish sentiment analysis researchers.

Easy to use matlab codes are presented. They requires Matlab 2018a or higher. 
6 methods are applied. Each of them can be run seperately.
1. sentiment_bo3grams.m : 3 character ngrams
2. sentiment_bow.m: bag of words
3. sentiment_CNN_char_based.m : char based CNNs
4. sentiment_CNN_word_based.m : word vector based CNNs
5. sentiment_lstm.m: word vector based LSTMs
6. sentiment_mean_word_embedding.m: mean word vectors

You can use them with your own datasets.
